## How it works
Supermic performes variable delay and sum beamforming on 8 mcirophones and outputs an I2S stream for easy processing.  First the microphone data is passed in through 8 input pins in DDR(Double Data Rate) format. From there the chip converts the data to SDR (Single Data Rate); 1 wire per microphone. Individual microphone data is then passed through a third order CIC (Cascading Integrator Comb) Filter to convert it from PDM (Pulse Density Modulation) format to PCM (Pulse-code Modulation). Each microphone's data is then passed through a shift register that acts as a configurable delay and summed.This is then outputted by a I2S bus. Additionally, it passesthrough individual PCM output for ease of use.

## How to test
### 1. Initial Setup
- **Connect Power Supply**
  - Ensure the module is correctly powered
- **Connect Clocks**
  - Connect a `3.072Mhz` clock to `bit_clk`(`uio_in[0]`)
  - Connect a `48khz` clock to `lr_clk`(`uio_in[1]`)
  - Ensure both clocks are aligned
- **Connect Microphones**
  - For each microphone, connect their `VCC` and `GND` pins to their respective sources
  - Connect their `clk` pin to a `3.072Mhz` clock
  - Configure left/right pairs such what there are 4 of each type.
  - For each left-right pair, combine their data wires (through a bread board for example) and connect them to `ui_in[2:5]`
- **Connect I2S reciever**
  - Connect an I2S reciever of your choice like a configured Raspberry Pi or supported speaker to the `Beamformed PCM Output` pin (`uio[5]`)
- **Configure Delays**
  - Use pins `uio[4:0]` to confiure delays from the table below. A delay of 1 represents a delay of 1 sample at a sample rate of `lr_clk`
- **(Optional) Connect I2S recievers for passthrough**
  - Connect I2S recievers of your choice like a configured Raspberry Pi or supported speaker to the pins `uo[0:7]`
### Monitor Output
- **Procedure**
  -  Enable I2S reciever
  -  Enable Clock Signals
  -  Record data from I2S reciever (Varies based on chosen reciever)

## External hardware
You need 8 digital microphones, a clock generator (can be a raspberry pi, microcontroller, etc.), and something that recieves the I2S output (this can be a rapberry pi or most audio output devices).
